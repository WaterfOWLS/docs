# Documentation
### IP Addresses
* DHCP could assign different IPs, so we manually configured the static IPs of the hardware.
* Raspberry Pi, 192.168.0.10
* Jetson TX2, 192.168.0.20

### Wire Colors
* We soldered new wires for compactibility, so these are the new hardware wiring colors.
* Servo motors - power (blue), control signal (orange), ground (brown)
* LIDAR - power (red), SCL (green), SDA (blue), ground (orange)
