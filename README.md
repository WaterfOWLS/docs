# Documentation
### IP Addresses
To avoid being potentially being assigned different IPs by DHCP, we have manually configured the static IPs of the hardware.
Raspberry Pi, 192.168.0.10
Jetson TX2, 192.168.0.20

### Wire Colors
We soldered on wires for these components to make them more compact, so these are the new colors for each wire.
Servo motors - power (blue), control signal (orange), ground (brown)
LIDAR - power (red), SCL (green), SDA (blue), ground (orange)
